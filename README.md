# Tech Issues and Their Solutions

🚀 A curated collection of real-world software development problems and their structured solutions.

This repository documents practical issues developers face across different domains of technology — along with clear explanations and solution approaches.

## 🎯 Purpose

In day-to-day development, we encounter:

- Architecture challenges  
- Debugging roadblocks  
- Framework limitations  
- Unexpected production issues  
- Cross-platform inconsistencies  

Often, structured and complete solutions are hard to find.

This repository exists to solve that problem.

Whenever I face a real-world issue, research it deeply, and solve it properly — I document it here so others don’t have to struggle the same way.
